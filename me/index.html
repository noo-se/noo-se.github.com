<b>Quick description</b>: Once upon a time I used to think I wanted to be an excellent, world class software engineer or architect that would build awesome and elegant solutions. Then I discovered I was more attuned to hacking things together in new and innovative proof-of-concept type projects or creating tools for others instead of vast empires of binary landscapes.
</p>
<p>I am currently in the mindset of breaking (reverse engineering) things and breaking into (pen-testing) things.</p>
<p>You may know me from my vlog series <a href="/path-to-oscp/">Path to OSCP</a> which details my journey through the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/">Penetration testing with Kali Linux</a> course and ends with me attaining <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/">OSCP</a> (spoiler!)</p>
<p>Other than that, I am found all over the web and sometimes even contributing to the conversation even if the contributions quite often are bad puns and reaction gifs.</p>
