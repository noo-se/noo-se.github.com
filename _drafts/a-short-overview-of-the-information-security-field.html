<p>Recently a call and ask me what are the actual jobsDid you do in information security like what are the actual day-to-day activities you get aroundAnd that got me thinking that information security is quite bright concept any doubt houses within it quite a few different subsections it's almost a wide term as IT in general because some of the sections of all subsections of information Security actually overlap with non-technical field is also paragraph enterobacter</p>
<p>Of course the one of the common most common sections of information security people think about isI guess network security just like firewalls access control lists and all that sort of things attacks being the date Dillard service tax botnets and so forth then the second one would be malware and also is a bad guys doing botnet send distributing children's job I exploit 70 daysKnow the third option or the food section would for example be forensics going through a computer's memory dump or disk image to see what someone has done either beards malicious person doing committing crimes and finding evidence for said activities or it could also be in an investigation of someone's computer being hacked in there being some malware SO forth and you want to investigate what that nowhere has done what sort of information has potentially leaked outside of your company and is over</p>
<p>The fourth kind of the intercept information security</p>
<p>Rocking versions of applications patches missing from operating systems and so forth</p>
<p>In addition to these more technical fields information security of course also is dealing with the law are and what sort of compliance issues you want to be thinking about you could be for example our PCI compliant because you are handling credit card information or you might be under the jurisdiction of the bar if you are handling patient information or your organisation might just want to be ISO 2700 compliance of course for security penetration testing there is always the red team and the blue team blue team being the day defenders who are trying to keep everything secure while the red team is the attackersDad can be for example an outside party that has been paid to attack your network and security posture. The red team requires more skills with for example developing exploits finding vulnerable versions of software are finding new ways to combine different levels of vulnerabilities into one workable remote privilege escalation issue.</p>
