<p>Former developer turned ops, learning reverse engineering (RE) and memory forensics (DFIR). I post about #<a href="/tag/infosec/">infosec</a> #<a href="/tag/sysadmin/">sysadmin</a> #<a href="/tag/malware/">malware</a> #<a href="/tag/vuln/">vuln</a> #<a href="/tag/RE/">RE</a></p>
<p>This site is split into two kinds of posts: original content I have written and curated links. I will always read the curated articles and include a small snippet of personal analysis - my two cents - on the links so I am not just churning out links without thinking about them.</p>
<p>Original content I write is still very much in development, I have written mostly about personal career development for the past few months, but that might change.</p>
