<p>After 8 more hours of studying, I have progressed +50 pages and +1:40h in video material. Most of my time has been spent running scans or fiddling around in hexadecimal trying to get exploits working.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was severely overwhelmed by how much data I am already beginning to gather -- open ftp servers, Samba shares, public SNMP enumeration etc.</p>
<p>I decided that I'll gather the raw data in KeepNote for further reading, but I am beginning to collect the main bits -- IP, hostname, domain/workgroup, OS etc. -- into a simple Excel spreadsheet that I am evolving as needed.</p>
<p>So far I have seen so many different Windows versions that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions">this Wikipedia page</a> came in handy since I haven't been in touch with the Windows world and forgot the version numbers :)</p>
<p>I also learned how you can resume nmap scans if needed!</p>
<pre>nmap -oN your-results.nmap $HOST
Ctrl-C^ here
# then later
nmap --resume your-results.nmap
</pre>
<p>And done! But as I learned, this does not work over VM suspends since it somehow relies on mmap() in the background -- I got an error when I tried...</p>
<p>Also, just some info on why progress with exercises takes longer than watching the relevant video:</p>
<pre># Single target scan that took ~2 hours
Completed SYN Stealth Scan at 18:02, 6768.89s elapsed (42000 total ports)

# The scan that wouldn't end:
NSE Timing: About 6.96% done; ETC: 00:21 (5:37:21 remaining)
NSE Timing: About 6.96% done; ETC: 00:41 (5:56:04 remaining)
NSE Timing: About 6.96% done; ETC: 01:02 (6:15:28 remaining)

...
NSE: Active NSE Script Threads: 1 (1 waiting)
NSE Timing: About 99.92% done; ETC: 20:32 (0:00:06 remaining)
</pre>
<p>Yeah.. that's from a single nmap scan of a <strong>single</strong> host! It was stuck at 99.92% for 1,5 hours before I went to sleep last night.</p>
<p>Another snippet of interest to anyone going to work with Kali:</p>
<pre>alias ss='import ~/ss-$(date +%F_%H%M_%S).png'</pre>
<p>It'll create a screenshot of the selected area and save the file in your home dir.</p>
<p>I'm really happy I've now had actual dealings with OllyDbg, Immunity debugger and edb (Evans Debugger) -- these will come in handy when I start focusing on reverse engineering after my OSCP course :)</p>
<p>Big thanks to anyone watching and especially leaving feedback of any form!</p>
