<p>I finished the materials between day 6 and 7. I thoroughly enjoyed them and learned many new things. Afterwards it felt like I was set adrift with no compass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I go?</li>
<li>Anywhere you want.</li>
<li>Where should I go?</li>
<li>. . .</li>
</ul>
<p>And then the guide was gone.</p>
<p>OH WELL. Better get crackin'.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as I mentioned previously, I had the good idea of setting long-running nmap scans loose on the network while doing other studying / exercises. One such scan was started just before midnight on Friday eve and it finished early Sunday morning, running time somewhere around 30+ hours.</p>
<p>It gave me a metric boatload of new information to read through -- over 10 thousand lines of nmap output!</p>
<p>As I am writing this, I have gone through 1/3rd of said report and have been patiently making notes for myself that ip .ABC is potentially vulnerable to Heartbleed and .XYZ might have some issues with SQL injection etc.</p>
<p>Now is where I start to do the first of two things:</p>
<blockquote><p>Enumerate, enumerate, enumerate.</p></blockquote>
<p>And once I have decided on targets -- and hopefully have not over-thought these ideas -- I will start trying out the different services for vulnerabilities. Poking with tools new and old and trying to get a foot in. And once all of that fails. I will do the second thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Try Harder!</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is the Offensive Security motto for learning and doing. Of course once I get into machines, I will be able to use root privileges to check the machines for alternative pathways in that I might have missed -- like non-privileged users having simple or reused password etc.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and here's the link to <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/">Metasploit Unleashed</a> that I mentioned in the vlog.</p>
<p>And as a continued effort, I keepÂ bookmarking worthwhile stuff into my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:unfo/t:oscp">Pinboard(unfo, oscp)</a> list.</p>
