<p>Maciej Cegłowski writes on his blog idlewords <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">a longish but to the point article on the causes and effects of big web pages</a>.</p>
<p>It starts off to a bit of a rocky start - in my view - with comparing the web site sizes to the literary works of Russian writers, but I don't think the physical comparison of web page sizes to big books is solid enough. But the article gets better and is definitely worth the read.</p>
<p>This topic especially tickles my fancy, since I have for a long time been a proponent of minimalism in "homepage design" and would've liked to make my own web presence on the web as lightweight as possible - preferably static html with little or no Javascript, but this failed due to my time resources =&gt; big CMS and big theme, not fully controlled by me.</p>
<p>One of the biggest things I am a fan of in his post is the fact that I believe ads should be served from the same host as the other contents. Ads should be meaningful to the target audience. Ads should be incorporated into the design in a non-intrusive manner. Ads should optimally be tailored to really help the user find things that are of interest to them.</p>
<p>Alas we do not live in such a world and ad-blockers are a must given the reality of malware ads being served even on big sites - even if usually for brief periods.</p>
<p>Another thing he bemoans is the amount of Javascript and design compromises needed to get a 'one size fits all' (responsive) design. I thoroughly believe that serving customized markup for different categories of devices is a better solution. This is fraught with its own problems of keeping up to date with classifications etc. but it makes for a better end-result as a 2008 Nokia barely-smart-enough-for-internet phone does not need to have the 512kB JS libs since it doesn't even know how to render table and so forth. There are some work-arounds, but I digress.</p>
