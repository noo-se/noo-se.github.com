<h1>YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!</h1>
<p>I have the first proof.txt from the lab machines.</p>
<p>This is a short update, just to mark this awesome day when I was able to get remote access to the first live lab machine.</p>
<p>Upon looking at the root of C:\ I found someone else's owned.exe and decided to revert the machine to its original state to make sure I had actually found my own way in instead of a weakened machine conf. I had!</p>
<p>I dumped hashes which I fed to john the ripper and was overly excited when john started spitting out passwords. ∠( ﾟдﾟ)／</p>
<p>The hashes did not permit to pivot anywhere by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">passing them around</a>. But at least I had my first success which gave me a big boost of confidence since this morning I was so bewildered about where to even begin attacking the network!</p>
<p>Next up: <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a>.</p>
