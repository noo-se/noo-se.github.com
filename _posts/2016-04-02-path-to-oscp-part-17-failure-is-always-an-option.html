<p>Now if you still want to see me go through the ups and downs of this exam, read on . . .</p>

<p>Things I can say without revealing anything of the exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like in the labs, I had <strong>important stuff</strong> just laying around on my hard disk due to lack of diligence. This made me waste several precious hours and quite a few slivers of sanity.</li>
<li>Like in the labs, I missed <strong>critical findings</strong> in my enumeration. It wasn't because I didn't follow my plan. It was because my plan didn't even include this thing. Yes. <em>That</em> big of an oversight on my part. Nothing special. Just basic stuff.</li>
<li>I was able to follow my plan and it did yield the first machine to be rooted in 4 hours or so. I was happy about this.</li>
<li>I got tunnelvision quite badly with one machine. For many hours. Even with breaks.</li>
<li>I did follow my schedule quite rigorously except for the first break which I decided to skip.</li>
</ul>
